## Operating the WAM arm for grasp recording study (Summer 2015)

SSH Traits:
	robot system name: WAM
	username: robot
	password: WAM

	ssh command: "ssh wam"

Required Setup:
	run "ifconfig" and verify that your wireless connection interface (wlan0) has the ip address 192.168.109.101
	run "sudo vim /etc/hosts" and verify that the name of your computer is in the hosts file with the above ip address (my computer is called eureka, and I know because when I log in, I get the prompt "jack@eureka:~"

# Running the setup
	Log into the wam (ssh wam) and run:
		roscore

	Log into the wam on another terminal and run:
		roslaunch wam_node wam_node.launch

	Log into a final terminal and run:
		rosrun wam_node grasp_capture.py
	

	On the host computer, open a new terminal and run:
		export ROS_MASTER_URI="http://WAM:11311"
		roslaunch bhand_sliders bhand_sliders.py

	Also on the host computer, open the last new terminal and run:
		export ROS_MASTER_URI="http://WAM:11311"
		rosrun wam_node sounder.py

	
	Go to the wam_node.launch terminal and follow its instructions to ininitialize the wam (it should go something like: "idle the WAM, set it in its home position, activate the WAM")
	If the wam activates and the hand initializes, the setup procedure should be complete. Go to the grasp_replication.py terminal and follow its instructions.
