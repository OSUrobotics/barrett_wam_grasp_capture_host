## Operating the WAM arm for grasp recording study (Summer 2015)

SSH Traits:
	robot system name: WAM
	username: robot
	password: WAM

	ssh command: "ssh wam"

Setup for a New Computer:
	In a terminal on your computer, run "ifconfig" and verify that your wireless network connection (wlan0) has the ip address 192.168.109.101

	In a terminal on the WAM, open the hosts file
		sudo vim /etc/hosts 
	and verify that the name of your computer is in the hosts file on its own line in the form
		192.168.109.101	myComputerName
	with the above ip address (my computer is called eureka, which I know because when I log in, I get the prompt "jack@eureka:~"

Verify Setup on a New Computer:
	In a terminal on the WAM try to ping the host computer:
		ping myComputerName
	Ping should start printing roundtrip times in the low milliseconds after 1-2 seconds of stalling


# Running the setup
	On a host computer terminal, run:
		roscore

	Log into the wam via ssh and run:
		export ROS_MASTER_URI="http://YOURCOMPUTERNAMEGOESHERE:11311"
		roslaunch wam_node wam_node.launch
	
	On the host computer, open a new terminal and run:
		roslaunch grasp_manager run_host.launch

	
	Go to the wam_node.launch terminal and follow its instructions to ininitialize the wam (it should go something like: "idle the WAM, set it in its home position, activate the WAM")
	If the wam activates and the hand initializes, the setup procedure should be complete. Go to the grasp_replication.py terminal and follow its instructions to commence testing.
