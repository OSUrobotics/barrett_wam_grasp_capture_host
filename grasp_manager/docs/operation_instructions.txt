## Operating the WAM arm for grasp recording study (Summer 2015)

SSH Info:
	robot system name: WAM
	username: robot
	password: WAM

	ssh command: "ssh wam"

# Software Overview:
	wam_node.launch:
		The wam node controls all mechanical operations for the wam and initiates the ROS interface for control. The wam node is also responsible for wam joint recording. These trajectories are moved from the wam to the host computer between each test via SFTP

	run_host.launch:
		This is the main controlling launch file. It starts:
			grasp_capture.py: the command and control interface. Takes user commands and implements the main workflow.
			bhand_sliders.py: Listens to the arduino via USB for changes in the sliders and the rotating potentiometer. Converts these values to finger closures and spread angles.
			sounder.py: Issues synchronizing sounds on the host computer
			bag_tools: a rosbag API listening for topics in the form of strings sent to the bag_record topic.
			sounder.py

Setup for a New Computer:
	In a terminal on your computer, run "ifconfig" and verify that your wireless network connection (wlan0) has the ip address 192.168.109.101

	In a terminal on the WAM, open the hosts file
		sudo vim /etc/hosts 
	and verify that the name of your computer is in the hosts file on its own line in the form
		192.168.109.101	myComputerName
	with the above ip address (my computer is called eureka, which I know because when I log in, I get the prompt "jack@eureka:~"

Verify Setup on a New Computer:
	In a terminal on the WAM try to ping the host computer:
		ping myComputerName
	Ping should start printing roundtrip times in the low milliseconds after 1-2 seconds of stalling


# Running the setup
	On a host computer terminal, run:
		roscore

	Log into the wam via ssh and run:
		. set_master_sonny
		roslaunch wam_node wam_node.launch
	
	On the host computer, open a new terminal and run:
		roslaunch grasp_manager run_host.launch

	Go to the wam_node.launch terminal and follow its instructions to ininitialize the wam (it should go something like: "idle the WAM, set it in its home position, activate the WAM")
	If the wam activates and the hand initializes, the setup procedure should be complete. Go to the grasp_replication.py terminal and follow its instructions to commence testing.
